## ShopSync Manager

ShopSync Manager is a JavaFX-based desktop application designed to streamline small tech shop operations. Manage product sales, repairs, mobile recharges, and inventoryâ€”all in one place. Powered by a SQLite backend, it offers real-time reporting, category-based product tracking (Phones, Headphones, etc.), and a user-friendly interface for shop owners on the go.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two default folders:

    src: Contains all source files (Java and FXML).
    lib: Holds dependencies (JavaFX SDK and SQLite JDBC).

## Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed manually via referenced libraries:

    Referenced Libraries:
        lib/**/*.jar (all JARs in lib/ and subdirectories)
        lib/sqlite-jdbc.jar (SQLite JDBC driver)
        lib/javafx-sdk (JavaFX SDK folder)

## Required Dependencies-

sqlite -jdbc 3.49.1.0 jar -- Rename as - sqlite-jdbc.jar
openjfx-23.0.2_linux-x64  -- Rename as - javafx-sdk (folder name) it should have lib folder inside

## Setup and Compilation

Prerequisites : JDK 17+ (e.g., OpenJDK or Oracle JDK)
Compile the database connection class:
javac -d bin -cp "lib/sqlite-jdbc.jar" src/database/DatabaseConnection.java


## Run to create tables in kingcom.db

java -cp "bin:lib/sqlite-jdbc.jar" database.DatabaseConnection

## Compile the Project from root dir

Compile all source files with dependencies:

javac --module-path "lib/javafx-sdk/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -cp "lib/sqlite-jdbc.jar" -d bin $(find src -name "*.java")

## Main App entry 

java --module-path "lib/javafx-sdk/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -cp "bin:lib/sqlite-jdbc.jar" gui.Main

## Command for tests from root dir
javac -d bin -cp "lib/sqlite-jdbc.jar" $(find src -name "*.java")
java -cp "bin:lib/sqlite-jdbc.jar" tests.RepairServiceTest
java --module-path "lib/javafx-sdk/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -cp "bin:lib/sqlite-jdbc.jar" tests.ReportServiceTest
